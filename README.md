# JS-Holiday-Pong
A JavaScript thingy I did on Khan Academy! It's supposed to be a holiday-themed pong...

This was an indepedent project we were told to do, by learning JavaScript on our own and cooking up a game. In order to complete this project, I had to complete various courses on JS that Khan Academy dutifully helped me through. Since it was close to the holiday season, I decided to make it Christmas-themed! Below you'll find the link for this project.
